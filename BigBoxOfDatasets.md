# Big Box of Datasets
This box is a bit different. It contains links to several different datasets that might be useful to programmers.

 - [IP2Location Lite](http://lite.ip2location.com/main) - A free(!) dataset that allows you to work out where in the world an IP address is located. Has both IPv4 and IPv6 datasets available!

# Big Box of Datasets
This box is a bit different. It contains links to several different datasets that might be useful to programmers.

 - [IP2Location Lite](http://lite.ip2location.com/main) - A free(!) dataset that allows you to work out where in the world an IP address is located. Has both IPv4 and IPv6 datasets available!
 - [Joe Reynolds' wordlists](http://joereynoldsaudio.com/Misc/wordlists) - A collection of various (free!) wordlists for all occasions.
 - [DevData](http://devdata.io/) - Convert datasets so they're ready for inclusion in several programming languages. Comes with a few datasets inbuilt, but you can addd your own.

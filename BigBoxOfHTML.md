# The Big Box of HTML

## Testing Tools
 - [.resizr](http://resizr.co/) - Responsive website testing tool
 - 

## Packaging Tools
 - [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) - Previously known as `node-webkit`, this tool lets you package your HTML / CSS / JS app into a bundle (native for your target desktop platform) with Blink & Node.JS.
 - [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) - An alternative to the above. Looks to be smaller, but I don't really know how it works.

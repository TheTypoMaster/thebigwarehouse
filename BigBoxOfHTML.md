# The Big Box of HTML

## Testing Tools
 - [.resizr](http://resizr.co/) - Responsive website testing tool
 - [webfont-test](http://webfont-test.com/) - Compare up to 3 fonts at once
 - [Google Fonts on Github](https://github.com/google/fonts) - A repository that contains the fonts available on [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts).


## Packaging Tools
 - [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) - Previously known as `node-webkit`, this tool lets you package your HTML / CSS / JS app into a bundle (native for your target desktop platform) with Blink & Node.JS.
 - [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) - An alternative to the above. Looks to be smaller, but I don't really know how it works.

## Support Websites
This section is a bit different - it contains link to sites that you might want to link to if a user of your website doesn't support a technology that you require.
 - [enable-javascript.com](http://enable-javascript.com/) - Shows the user how to enable javascript in their browser
 - [What Browser?](https://whatbrowser.org/) - Useful to link to if a user has an outdated browser

## Other
 - [SRI Hash Generator](https://srihash.org/) - Compute the SRI hash for the resource at a given url. See [cloudflare's blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/an-introduction-to-javascript-based-ddos/) (Scroll to the section on "Subresource Integrity") for more information.
